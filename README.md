===============

Teamwork project with Meteor

I started this project for two reasons :
- I wanted to have a Trello-like application in order manage some projects but with specifics 
functionalities and the ability to install a server where I want. As Trello doesn't let you extend 
it or executed it as you want, I needed to developp this.
- I am interested in Meteor technologies. It sounds very exciting and powerful. And more over, Meteor seemed to be a 
perfect technologie to developp a Trello like application.

This project is open. I would also like to make this project a complete example 
of the best pratices for Meteor, JS and Web developpement. But I'm discoring it little by little so it means refactoring
very often... 

I also use Trello (for now) to organise the developpement of Teamwork.
