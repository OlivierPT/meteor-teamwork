meteor-teamwork
===============

Teamwork is an organizing activity application, designed to make any kind of activity, either personal, either team,
easy to organise, to follow and to success. It is build with the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> Framework.

It has been mainly inspired by <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> that is an application that I really like to use.
But as Trello couldn't be extended, personnalised and you can't fully control your datas, I was kinda frustrated with it.

So I decide to try to create my own activity organizing application with Meteor that is a perfect candidate to create a "Trello like" application
like Teamwork. And for me, it's a perfect occasion to learn how to use Meteor.
I hope to be able to add many new functionnalities to Teamwork in order to make it a perfect tools for agile and adaptive tool to managed every 
kind of project in the enterprise world.

This project is open-source and it aims also to be a complete Meteor example of the best pratices for Meteor, JS and Web developpement. 
As I'm discovering it little by little in the same, it also means refactoring often... 

I also use Trello (for now) to organise the developpement of Teamwork.
