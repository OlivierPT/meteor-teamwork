                Teamwork is an organizing activity application, designed to make any kind of activity, either personal, either team,
                easy to organise, to follow and to success.

                It has been mainly inspired by <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> that is an application 
                that I really like to use.
                But Trello couldn't be extended, personnalised and you can't fully control your datas so I was
                kinda frustrated with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the same time, I discovered <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> that is web application framework that
                make developping reactive web applications very easy. So it's a perfect candidate to create a "Trello like" application
                like Teamwork. And for me, it's a perfect occasion to learn how to use Meteor.

                Here, it's a demo of the current application that let you see what Teamwork is and what you can do with it. 
                This demo will be updated regularly depending of the evolution of the project.
